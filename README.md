# weather_app
# This is my first project in which I integrated a 3rd party API in my project 
This project contain simple implementation of wether API from RAPID API(Free)
In this project I received data from rapid-api then converted into Json format
then serve upon the request of user.
No data is stored (except city name ,which can be used in multiple site) in my Database rather I call and Present data to user directly from rapid-api
Please don't forget to make recommendation to improve my project
